# SPA-Boilerplate
Minimal setup for the current JS flavours of the month.

ES6, React, Webpack, Scss & Bootstrap.

With the least amount of boilerplate, no tests, routes, build scripts, servers, dev / production etc.
Just the code required to output a header content and footer.

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
