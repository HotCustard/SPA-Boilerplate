# SPA-Boilerplate
Minimal setup for the current JS flavours of the month.

Intended to allow the nice features of ES6, React, Webpack, Scss & Bootstrap.
With the least amount of boilerplate, no tests, routes, build scripts, dev / production etc.
Just the code required to output a header content and footer.
